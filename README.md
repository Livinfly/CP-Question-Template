# CP-Question-Template

## Introduction

This is a question work flow for myself (maybe just today...).

There are more convenient ways like `polygon` which I would try to use in these days.

But... I have made this work flow, so why not share it. XD

All files about the question will place in one file folder.

## Usage

You may write your `std` (standard program) first, and write generation program in `data-generator` folder.

Then following things in `data` folder.

Place the `*.exe` generated by your `std` , and put it in `data` folder.

Get `gen.exe` or something like that here, modify and use `gen.bat` here to generate your data.

To do simple self-judge, you can copy a piece of data you just generate to `self-judge`, and may modify the `judge.bat` to cater for your needs. 

My `judge.bat` version is run `my.exe` generated by `my.cpp`, input all `*.in` and output to `*.out` , then compare it with `*.ans`, finally show the `AC/TOT`. Also, if the program exceeds 1000 ms, it's regarded as wrong (but no stop on it). 

You can put your data `*.in`/`*.ans` or `*.out` here.

## Note

If you do this work on windows, it's recommended that use `dos2unix` on linux to translate `crlf` to `lf` to avoid some problem.
